# Do-Thing-That-Dont-Scale
###Let's work together to focus on getting your first 1000 users.


"One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to do things that don't scale." - Paul Graham.

A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don't. You build something, make it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case the market must not exist.

Developers hope to find some users to test their app before they officially launch it in App Store. However, the truth is, it's not easy for most of developers to find a lot of users to test their apps. But, hackers in Hackthon are actually the group of people that are willing to test newly developed apps and are able to give valuable advices. So DO THINGS THAT DON'T SCALE provides a platform to let these people find each others. It makes impossible things to be possible.
